[LibraryClasses]
  ## @libraryclass  Provide unit test assert helpers
  UnitTestAssertLib|Include/Library/UnitTestAssertLib.h

  ## @libraryclass  Provides a library function that can be customized to set
  #                 the platform to boot from USB on the next boot.
  UnitTestBootUsbLib|Include/Library/UnitTestBootUsbLib.h

  ## @libraryclass  Provides a unit test framework
  UnitTestLib|Include/Library/UnitTestLib.h

  ## @libraryclass  Provides a unit test framework logging.  This allows tests
  #                 to focus on testing logic and the library to handle unit
  #                 test specific logging.
  UnitTestLogLib|Include/Library/UnitTestLogLib.h

  ## @libraryclass  Provides functions to save and restore unit test internal
  #                 state, in case the test needs to pause and resume (eg. a
  #                 reboot-based test).
  UnitTestPersistenceLib|Include/Library/UnitTestPersistenceLib.h

  ## @libraryclass  Provides a unit test result report.  This allows new result
  #                 output formats to be easily customized.
