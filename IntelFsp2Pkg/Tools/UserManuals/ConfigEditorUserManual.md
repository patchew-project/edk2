# ConfigEditor.py is a python script with a GUI interface that can support changing configuration settings directly from the interface without having to modify the source.

This tool depends on Python GUI tool kit Tkinter. It runs on both Windows and Linux.

It supports:

- Load the YAML file for a FSP UPD into the ConfigEditor to change the desired configuration values

- Generate a new configuration delta file or a config binary blob for the newly changed values to take effect

## Running Configuration Editor:

   **python ConfigEditor.py**  

For example:
