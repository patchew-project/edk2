## 1. HOW TO CREATE A FULL SOURCE TREE

1. Get Release Notes and Binary Object Modules from https://firmware.intel.com/projects/minnowboard-max

   Follow the instructions in the Release Notes to create a full source tree.

## 2. HOW TO BUILD (WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT)

Windows System Configuration:
  Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit*

1. Setup Build Environment

   1. Install Visual Studio 2008/2010/2012/2013 on the build machine.

   2. Install the latest Python 2 Release from: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
      * Make sure that a file with the extension of ".py" will be opened by Python.exe.

2. Extract Source Code
   1. Follow the instructions of "HOW TO CREATE A FULL SOURCE TREE" (step 2 above)
      to create a full source tree.

   2. Follow the instructions found in the file "Patch-HOWTO.txt" located in your
      workspace (e.g. "C:\MyWorkspace\CryptoPkg\Library\OpensslLib\Patch-HOWTO.txt") 
      to install the Openssl source code.

3. Install the iasl compiler by downloading iasl-win-20141107.zip from the following
   location: "https://acpica.org/downloads/version-20141107" and place the unzipped
   content ("iasl.exe") into the directory "C:\ASL" on your local hard drive
   (create the folder "C:\ASL" if it does not exist).
   
4a. Build Steps (32-bit)

   1. To build a 32-bit release version
      * Open a command prompt of Microsoft Visual Studio, such as "Developer Command Prompt for VS2013";
      * Type the command: `cd C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\Vlv2TbltDevicePkg`
      * Type the command: `Build_IFWI.bat /IA32 MNW2 Release` to build a release version.

   2. To build a 32-bit debug version
      * Open a command prompt of Microsoft Visual Studio, such as "Developer Command Prompt for VS2013";
      * Type the command: `cd C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\Vlv2TbltDevicePkg`
      * Type the command: `Build_IFWI.bat /IA32 MNW2 Debug` to build a debug version.

   3. After the build successfully completes, the 8MB firmware binary image will be located in the
       following location on your local hard drive:

      "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\Vlv2TbltDevicePkg\Stitch\"

4b. Build Steps (64-bit)

   1. To build a 64-bit release version
      * Open a command prompt of Microsoft Visual Studio, such as "Developer Command Prompt for VS2013";
      * Type the command: `cd C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\Vlv2TbltDevicePkg`
      * Type the command: `Build_IFWI.bat MNW2 Release` to build a release version.

   2. To build a 64-bit debug version
      * Open a command prompt of Microsoft Visual Studio, such as "Developer Command Prompt for VS2013";
      * Type the command: `cd C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\Vlv2TbltDevicePkg`
      * Type the command: `Build_IFWI.bat MNW2 Debug` to build a debug version.

   3. After the build successfully completes, the 8MB firmware binary image will be located in the
      following location on your local hard drive:

      "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2-platforms\Vlv2TbltDevicePkg\Stitch\"
