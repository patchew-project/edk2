## @file
#  Instance of RNG (Random Number Generator) Library.
#
#  BaseRng Library that uses the TimerLib to provide reasonably random numbers.
#  Do not use this on a production system as this uses the system performance
#  counter rather than a true source of random in addition to have a weak random
#  algorithm.
